# BTRFS CREATE
A fork created by Barry to integrate with his arch linux auto-installation script

## What has been redone

- Removed the creation of a separate home partition
- Added a choice of disk type (hdd or ssd)
- added automatic generation of fstab and loading my repository with archlinux auto-installation files
